# Redux Middleware - A DIY Guide

This is a companion repository for the [talk given at ReactJS bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Bangalore/events/244815606/)

## What are we building

We'll be building a simple error logging redux middleware. Any action that carries a payload with `error: true` will be handled by this middleware and the error will be logged on the server

## Getting Started

### Setting up the project

- Clone the repository
- The `master` branch contains the full solution. To follow along the talk, checkout the `start` branch!
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm start` and visit `localhost:1337` to see the app in action. :rocket:
